Global money transfer systems face significant challenges, including:

- **High Costs:** Traditional remittance services charge exorbitant fees, making it expensive for individuals to send money across borders.
- **Slow Transactions:** Cross-border payments can take several days to process due to intermediaries and banking delays.
- **Limited Accessibility:** Underbanked populations, especially in developing countries, struggle to access reliable and affordable financial services.
- **Currency Volatility:** Users in unstable economies face constant risks from fluctuating local currencies.
- **Lack of Transparency:** Centralized systems often lack transparency, leading to issues of trust and inefficiency.

These issues hinder economic growth and exacerbate inequalities, especially for low-income families reliant on remittances.
